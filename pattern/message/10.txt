@receiver@ We add a candle to the richest cake over the world, for the best friend of the galaxy. Finding friends like you is not easy, so I think we both deserve a round of applause. Having another year is a symbol of experience, of having won battles, and better answers to difficult life events. Happy birthday dear friend, I hope to be near you to celebrate many more. @sender@
