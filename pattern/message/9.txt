@receiver@ I have traveled thousands of streets and shops in search of a mind that is able to steal your breathe, that was something that you had not expected not even in two hundred years. I think I have raised way too much your expectations, because what I found was a friendship, the most sincere than anyone could ever find: you. I hope you like my message, happy day. @sender@
