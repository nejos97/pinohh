There are certain little things in life that we know for sure in the world. @receiver@ One is that time passes and the other is that we must make it worth living as much as possible. By your side, and with the incredible friendship that you offer me, I know that everything is possible. I wish you the best birthday you could possibly have, for you are a true friend. @sender@
